Been trying to learn how to build REST API using Laravel and trying apply the best practices building it.
Trying to do this from scratch to really understand concepts and how it all works in laravel.

If you are knowledgable in laravel and you think im doing something wrongill be happy to hear it 😁😊.

Im trying to make a simple social media app in this and planning to use react in the client side.

typical social media:
    posts CRUD
    reactions 
    comments CRUD
    feed
    following/followers
    Profiles
    
Please, if you are here and you think you know more than me in doing this. I would be very happy to  hear your thoughts.

thank you in advance 😁👌
