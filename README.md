This project is an API service to provide a backend functionality for my project which is a I think would be a X/twitter clone.
Or atleast that's what i'm tryiing to do cause i cant think of any ideas of what to build to showcase my skills in my personal portfolio.

Anyways, HAHA.

While im building this, im also trying to learn backend development. So if you think i'm doing something wrong or you have something to suggest or tips for me. please feel free (actually dri talaga ak sure kun nag aano ak. HAHAHA).
